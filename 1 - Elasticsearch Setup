1 - Elasticsearch Setup on Ubuntu Server

This guide documents the installation and configuration of ElasticSearch on Ubuntu server hosted on Vultr. The server is optimized with 400GB storage, 4vCPUs, and 16GB memory. It is configured on a VPC network with the following public and private IP addresses:
•	Private IP: 10.3.96.3
•	Public IP: 216.128.134.227
•	Hostname: SOC-ELK-Server

Elasticsearch Installation

1.	Go to: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch and copy the link to the ‘.deb’ package
 
2.	In the Ubuntu server terminal, type the following command to download the package: wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.17.2-amd64.deb
 
3.	Install the package with the following command: sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-8.17.2-amd64.deb
 
4.	Copy the generated “Security Autoconfiguration Information” to save to a file. The information contains the generated password to login to Elasticsearch and information to reset the password.
 
5.	Change directory to Elasticsearch
 
6.	Open the YAML file for Elasticsearch that contains all the configuration settings with the following command: nano elasticsearch.yml
 
7.	Change host IP, remove comment (#), and paste in IP of device/server. Also, remove the comment for http.port. So, when our SOC analyst connects to the Elasticsearch instance, it will be with the public IP and port specified.
 
8.	Reload, enable, and start the Elasticsearch daemon with the following commands:
    a.	systemctl daemon-reload
    b.	systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    c.	systemctl start elasticsearch.service
