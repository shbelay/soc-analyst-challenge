# SOC Project Challenge

## Objective

My SOC (Security Operations Center) challenge created by MyDFIR (https://youtu.be/W3ExS2m6B24?si=1BlDTSc7zB-BYD02) is to demonstrate the setup and configuration of a comprehensive cybersecurity environment. The project focuses on creating and managing an Elastic and Kibana instance, deploying ELK Stack for log ingestion (including Sysmon from endpoints), and developing dashboards and alerts. I'll cover the detection and investigation of malware, SSH and RDP brute force activities from public servers. Additionally, I'll demonstrate the implementation of a command-and-control (C2) server using Mythic for simulated attack scenarios and integrating a ticketing system to streamline incident investigations and responses. Overall, the challenge emphasizes hands-on learning with logical diagrams and step-by-step documentation for practical cybersecurity operations.

### Tools Used

- Vultr: A cloud service for hosting and deploying the servers and network architecture.  
- Elastic Stack (ELK): The acronym ELK stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. It will be used for centralized monitoring and visualizing logs. 
- Elastic Defend: A solution to detect and respond to endpoint threats in real-time.  
- Fleet Server: A centralized system for managing endpoint agents and gathering telemetry data.  
- osTicket: A ticketing tool for organizing and streamlining incident management workflows.  
- Mythic C2: A command and control framework that enables attack simulations through custom payloads.  
- Kali Linux: A Linux platform for penetration testing exercises.
